Dear user, this package provides the vim addon supercollider-vim, but it is
not enabled by default. If you want to enable it for your user account just
execute:

vim-addons install supercollider

Similarly, to enable it for all users of this system just execute (as root):

vim-addons -w install supercollider

vim-addons is provided by the vim-addon-manager package, have a look at its
manpage for more information.
