supercollider (1:3.9.3+repack-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * upgraded to the newest upstream source
  * modified the watch file to add the suffix +repack instead of -repack
    so the deb release is not lesser than the upstream package, which
    might be misleading
  * updated debian patches; two of them are refreshed (fuzzy patching
    was successful), the others deletes since they were already integrated
    upstream.
  * modified d/supercollider-vim.install since the only stuff related to
    vim is built under editors/, and much of the files installed in the
    previous debian release are missing from the build tree; this results
    probably in a useless package for supercollider-vim.
  * disabled the use of ccache by patching CMakeLists.txt; this has no
    backdraw for debuilding since the compilation is done only once.

supercollider (1:3.8.0~repack-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Demote Depends of supercollider-language on supercollider-server to a Recommends.
    Normal users are expected to install the supercollider package, and
    this allows advanced users to install only the language and have a
    remote server. (Closes: #810006)
  * Don't let the build system enable sse on i386.
    It's not part of mainline. (Closes: #878346).
  * Remove autodetection of raspberry cpus.
    In debian we don't actually target raspberries, and guessing based on the build machine
    is wrong too (Closes: #878347)
